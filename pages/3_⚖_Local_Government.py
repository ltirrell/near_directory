    Data was acquired from Flipside Crypto's NEAR tables, as well as [Figment's Enriched APIs](https://docs.figment.io/network-documentation/near/enriched-apis) for more real time information.

    Governance queries were adopted from [excellent work](https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/dashboard/citizens-of-near-THIJUc) done on previous bounties by [@darksoulsfanlol](https://twitter.com/darksoulsfanlol).

    The "Year to date record" secion uses Flipside data, while other sections use Figment's API.

    All code is available on github, with the interactive validator query in the "My representative" section available [here](https://github.com/ltirrell/flipside_bounties/blob/main/near/gov_utils.py#L278).

    Other queries are hosted on Flipside Crytpo here:
